# Merge Sort

## Explanation

Merge Sort

- O(n*log(n)) speed
- sorting algorithm

for each array of length n > 1
split into two arrays and iterate until the arrays are of 1 element each
for each pair of elements/array of elements, combine them and sort iteratively until the full sorted array is recovered
